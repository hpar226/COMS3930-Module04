<h4>The Build</h4>
Teh C4tB0x is a toy with actuators to make a butterfly spin around using a stepper motor and a straw sweep back and forth using a stepper motor. A cardboard box that came with a keyboard was a perfect size to easily house the ESP32 breadboard and mount the motors. I used a cat toy, here is what it started out as, I snapped off the top tray that holds the butterfly on a wire:
